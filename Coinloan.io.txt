The function L provided is a hash function that combines a string and an additional value to produce a 32-bit hash. It appears to be based on a variation of the MurmurHash algorithm, which is a non-cryptographic hash function. Here's a breakdown of how it works, and how it is used to generate req_id from email and password.

Function Breakdown
Function Definition and Parameters:

```function L(e, t) {
    return function(e, s) {
        var t, n, h1, o, r, l, c, i;
        // Hash computation here
        return (h1 ^= h1 >>> 16) >>> 0;
    }(function(s) {
        s = unescape(encodeURIComponent(s));
        for (var e = "", i = 0; i < s.length; i++)
            e += s.charCodeAt(i).toString(16);
        return e;
    }(e + t), 8);
}```
Inner Function:

```function(e, s) {
    var t, n, h1, o, r, l, c, i;
    for (t = 3 & e.length,
    n = e.length - t,
    h1 = s,
    r = 3432918353,
    l = 461845907,
    i = 0; i < n; ) {
        // Hashing process
    }
    // Final hashing steps
    return (h1 ^= h1 >>> 16) >>> 0;
}```
This function performs the hashing using various bitwise operations and constants.
It processes the input string e and a seed value s to produce the hash.
String to Hexadecimal Conversion:


```function(s) {
    s = unescape(encodeURIComponent(s));
    for (var e = "", i = 0; i < s.length; i++)
        e += s.charCodeAt(i).toString(16);
    return e;
}```
Converts the input string (concatenated with the seed) to a hexadecimal representation.
Combining Email and Password:

```var email = USER;
var password = PASS;
var req_id = L(email, password);```
L is called with email and password, where email and password are placeholders for actual values.
How It Works
Concatenation and Encoding:

The email and password are concatenated into a single string.
This concatenated string is then URL-encoded and converted to a hexadecimal string.
Hash Calculation:

The hexadecimal string is processed by the inner function to produce a 32-bit hash value.
The inner function uses a series of bitwise operations and multiplications to compute the hash.
Output:

The result is a 32-bit unsigned integer that represents the hash of the concatenated email and password.
